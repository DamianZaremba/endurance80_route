Endurance 80 route map
=======================

Simple google map api hack to plot OSGB references. Currently using it to plot the endurance80 route as I'm considering finding some insane people to do it next year.

phpcoord.php was downloaded from http://www.jstott.me.uk/phpcoord/ and is avaible under the GPL license.
All other code is licensed under GPLv3 and is free as in freedom not beer.

How to use?
-----------

You should pretty much be able to just drop the code in place - the one thing that needs changing is the google API key.
Get a key from http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html and change key=ABQIAAAAArKyS_yRXmMvmOZ3CeYtMhSbVERVGJZi4Ct5OgVLzBqpvd-PzhS6jpIwg6wG4gGTbtAAFQsA2MKi5A to key={{YOUR KEY}}
